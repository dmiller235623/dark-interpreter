audio.c hardware.c mainbuffer.c datagen.c

with headers...

* programming

: PATH=~/sat/bin:$PATH
: PATH=~/stm32f4/stlink/flash:$PATH

: make stlink_flash

connection on own board is VDD, SCLCK, SWDIO, GND (so last 2 are
swapped from STLINK board)

* TODO:

0- all code structure with headers

1-audio codec/left and right

2-hardware switches

2.5-test audio in/out straight

3-/buffer treatment

(read from lists of grain size and position, what to do if fill buffer
part way through grain?)

4-PWM

5-filter and hardware

6-datagens - backwards, code chunks, symmetry, code direction and recoding

7-stack/frame
